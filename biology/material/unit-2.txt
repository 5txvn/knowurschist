Quiescent cells - Temporarily inactive and in G0, but can re-enter the cell cycle

Senescent cells - In G0 permanently, have exited the cell cycle (neurons)

Binary fission - Cell splits into two equal parts (bacteria, amoeba)

Budding - New organism grows as a small outgrowth from parent (yeast, hydra)

Fragmentation - Parent breaks into pieces, forming new organisms

Isogamy - Fusion of morphologically similar gametes (algae)

Anisogamy - Fusion of different-sized gametes (most animals/plants)

Oogamy - Special form of anisogamy, large non-motile egg + small motile sperm (humans, mammals)

Pericentric Chromosomal Inversion - Inversion which includes centromere

Paracentric Chromosomal Inversion - Inversion which occurs within ONE chromosomal arm

SSBPs - Prevent reannealing (regluing) of DNA

Bacterial transformation - Taking free DNA from environment and incorporating it into the genome

Bacterial conjugation - Directly transferring DNA to another bacterium through sex pilus

Interphase - Cell grows and copies DNA

Prophase - DNA coils into chromosomes

Metaphase - Chromosomes align in middle of cell

Anaphase - Chromosomes are pulled apart

Telophase - Two new nuclei form

Cytokinesis - Cell membrane pinches and two identical cells form

G1 Phase - Cell grows, carries out normal functions, prepares to replicate DNA

S Phase - Synthesis, cell replicates DNA

G2 Phase - Cell grows, checks for DNA errors, prepares for mitosis

Proto-oncogenes - Codes for proteins that regulate cell growth, division, and differentiation

Oncogene - Mutated proto-oncogene that causes uncontrolled cell growth

Tumor suppressor gene - Gene that codes for proteins that slow cell division and repair DNA (p53)

Apoptosis - Programmed cell death

Aneuploidy - Abnormal number of one chromosome set, includes monosomy and trisomy

Monosomy - One copy of a chromosome (2n-1)

Turner Syndrome - Monosomy X (missing one sex chromosome)

Trisomy - Three copies of a chromosome (2n+1)

Down Syndrome - Trisomy 21

Edward’s Syndrome - Trisomy 18

Patau Syndrome - Trisomy 13

Polyploidy - More than 2 sets of chromosomes (3n, 4n, …)

DNA Polymerase - Synthesizes DNA by adding nucleotides to chain

Helicase - Unwinds DNA at replication forks

Primase - Lays down RNA primers to start DNA synthesis

Ligase - Joins Okazaki fragments on lagging strang

Topoisomerase - Relieves supercoiling of DNA

Telomerase - Adds repetitive sequences to ends of chromosomes (telomeres)

Cleavage Furrow - Shallow groove that forms on surface of cells during cytokinesis

Differentiation - Cell becomes specialized in function

Tissue Tropism - Affinity of viruses to infect a particular type of cell
