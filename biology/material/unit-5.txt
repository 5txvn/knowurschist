Epistasis - One gene modifies the expression of another gene

Incomplete dominance - Heterozygote shows intermediate phenotype (pink rose)

Codominance - Both alleles are fully expressed at the same time (AB blood)

Pleiotropy - Single gene affects multiple seemingly unrelated traits

Polygenic inheritance - Trait is controlled by multiple genes

Multiple alleles - More than two alleles exist in population for gene (blood)

Hemizygous - Having only one copy of a gene instead of two (sex genes)

Law of Segregation - Each organism has two alleles for a gene, separated in meiosis and eventually recombine

Law of Independent Assortment - Alleles of different genes separate independently (eye color independent to hair color)

Law of Dominance - Dominant alleles mask recessive ones

Heredity - Passing of traits from parents to offspring

Southern Blot - Detects if specific DNA sequence is present

Northern Blot - Detects if RNA (usually mRNA) sequence is present/whether gene is being expressed

Western Blot - Detects presence of proteins and their size

Eastern Blot - Detects post-translational modifications of proteins

Southwestern Blot - Detects DNA-binding proteins

Northwestern Blot - Detects RNA-binding proteins

Plasmids - Small, circular DNA molecules in bacteria used in genetic engineering

Vectors - Tools like plasmids or viruses used to transfer genetic material

Wild Phenotype - Normal characteristics exhibited by organism (no mutations)

Autosome - Chromosome that isn’t linked to sex

Locus - Location on a chromosome where a particular gene is found
