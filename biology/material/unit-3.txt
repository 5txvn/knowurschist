Cofactor - Non-protein chemical compound required for an enzyme’s activity

Coenzyme - Small organic molecule that binds to enzymes and assists in catalysis, derived from vitamins

Competitive Inhibitor - Binds to active site, blocks substrate from binding

Non-competitive Inhibitor - Binds to allosteric site, changing enzyme shape and reducing activity

Irreversible Inhibitor - Permanently inactivates enzyme through covalent binding

Substrate - Molecule upon which an enzyme acts

C3 - Most common plant type (~85%), includes rice, wheat, soybeans, most trees in cool, moist environments, occurs when CO2 is fixed into 3-PGA, photorespiration occurs at higher temps

C4 - Adapted to hot, dry environments, includes corn, sugarcane, millet, CO2 is instead fixed into 4-carbon compound, reduces photorespiration

CAM - Adapted to extremely dry environments, CO2 fixation is temporally separated rather than spatially since stomata open at night and close during the day

Catabolic/Exergonic - Breaks down molecules, releases energy

Anabolic - Builds up molecules, requires energy
