Squamous Epithelial - Single-layer flat cells, lines alveoli and blood vessels

Cuboidal Epithelial - Single-layer cube cells, line kidney tubules, secretory portions of small glands

Columnar Epithelial - Single-layer tall cells, line digestive tract

Transitional Epithelial - Specialized stratified shape-changing cells, line urinary bladder

Continuous Conduction - Travel of action potential down unmyelinated axons, slow (0.5-10 m/s) because it uses more pumps

Saltatory Conduction - Travel of action potential down myelinated axons, 15-30x faster b/c electrical signals jump

HPA Axis - Stress response, hypothalamus releases CRH, this stimulates pituitary to release ACTH, this triggers the release of cortisol in the adrenal glands

Dendrite - Branched extensions that receive neurotransmitter signals, carrying them to cell body

Soma - Cell body of neuron containing nucleus

Axon - Long projection that conducts electrical impulses to other cells

Axon hillock - Region where axon behind, sums incoming signals and determines action potential

Myelin sheath - Fatty insulating covering around axons that increase transmission speed

Nodes of Ranvier - Gaps between myelin segments, regenerates action potential

Axon terminal - End of axon that releases neurotransmitters into synapse

Synapse - Functional junction where neurons communicate

Synaptic cleft - Small gap between presynaptic and postsynaptic cells

Presynaptic Neuron - Neuron that releases neurotransmitters

Postsynaptic Neuron - Neuron that receives signals

Glial cells - Non-neuronal cells that support, protect, and maintain neurons

Astrocytes - Glial cells that regulate the chemical environment

Oligodendrocytes - Glial cells that form myelin in CNS

Schwann cells - Glial cells that form myelin in PNS

Lymphocytes - WBCs for adaptive immune response, includes B cells, T cells, NK cells

T cells - WBC that controls cell-mediated immunity, recognizing and killing infected cells or activating other immune cells

B cells - WBC involved in humoral immunity, producing antibodies that bind to antigens and neutralize pathogens

Erythrocytes - RBC that transports oxygen to lungs and carries carbon dioxide to lungs

Neutrophils - WBC and first-responder phagocyte, destroying bacteria and fungi

Eosinophils - WBC involved in fighting parasites and allergic reactions, red/orange

Basophiles - WBC that releases histamine, triggering inflammation and allergic responses, not abundant and dark purple

Monocyte - Very large kidney-shaped WBC that become macrophages (engulf bacteria, debris, viruses, etc.)

Right atrium (RA) - Receives deoxygenated blood from body

Right ventricle (RV) - Pumps blood to lungs

Left atrium (LA) - Receives oxygenated blood from lungs

Left ventricle (LV) - Pumps oxygen-rich blood to body

Valves - Prevents backflow of blood

Tricuspid valve - Between RA and RV, atrioventricular

Pulmonary valve - Between RV and PA, semilunar

Mitral/bicuspid valve - Between LA and LV, atrioventricular

Aortic valve - Between LV and aorta, semilunar

Blood - Fluid connective tissue transporting substances

Platelets - Help w/blood clotting

White Blood Cells - Fight infection

Red Blood Cells - Carry oxygen using hemoglobin

Plasma - Liquid portion of blood carrying nutrients, hormones, wastes

Arteries - Thick vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart

Pulmonary artery (PA) - Carries blood away from heart for oxygenation

Arterioles - Smaller branches of arteries leading to capillaries

Capillaries - Thin vessels where exchange of gases and nutrients occurs

Venules - Small veins collecting blood from capillaries

Veins - Vessels that carry deoxygenated blood back to heart

Pulmonary veins (PV) - Carries oxygenated blood towards the heart

Aorta - Largest artery, carries blood from LV to body

Carotid - Major arteries in the neck, critical for brain oxygenation

Vena Cava - Largest veins, superior is upper body, inferior is lower, returns blood to RA

Osteoblasts - Bone-building cells that produce and secrete bone matrix

Myofibril - Long, threadlike structures in muscle cells, made of repeating sarcomeres

Axon - Long extension of neuron that carries electrical impulses

Open Circulatory System - Fluid (hemolymph) bathes organs and tissues directly (invertebrae)

Hypercalcemia - Elevated blood calcium, caused by hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D toxicity, cancer
