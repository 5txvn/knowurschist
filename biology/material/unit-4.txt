Chaperone Protein - assists in proper folding of polypeptides

Ubiquitin - Small protein that marks other proteins for degradation by proteasome

Inducer - Molecule that activates gene expression by preventing repressors from blocking transcription or activating activators

Promoter - DNA sequence where RNA polymerase binds to start transcription

Repressor - Protein that binds to operator to block transcription of gene

Corepressor - Molecule that activates repressor so it can bind to DNA

RNA Polymerase - Synthesizes RNA from DNA template during transcription

Silent Mutation - Single nucleotide changes but amino acid stays the same

Missense Mutation - Single nucleotide changes and codes for different amino acid

Nonsense Mutation - Single nucleotide changes and creates stop codon

Insertion - Nucleotides are added to DNA sequences (frameshift)

Deletion - Nucleotides are removed from DNA sequences (frameshift)

Chromosome Duplication - Segment of chromosome is copied, makes chromosomes look longer

Chromosome Translocation - Chromosome parts break off and attach to one another

Chromosome Deletion - Segment of chromosome is lost

Chromosome Inversion - Segment of chromosome is flipped

tRNA - Transfers amino acids to ribosomes, contains acceptor stem, T, D, anticodon, and variable loops

Mutagen - Factor that causes mutations in DNA

Carcinogen - Mutagen that specifically increases cancer risk

Apoptosis - Programmed cell death

Somatic mutation - Mutation in a non-reproductive cell, not passed to offspring

Germline mutation - Mutation in a reproductive cell, can be passed to offspring
