Guard Cells - In the epidermis of leaves/stems, responsible for opening & closing stomata

Vessel Elements - Water pipes in xylem, reinforced with lignin

Sieve Cells - Highway, long cells in phloem that allow sugar to flow, lack nucleus/ribosomes

Companion Cells - Life support for sieve cells, loads sugar into sieve tube using ATP

Endemic - Species native to only one geographic location

Positive tropism - Growth towards stimulus

Negative tropism - Growth away from stimulus

Bacteria - Prokaryotic unicellular domain, cell walls contain peptidoglycan, DNA is circular, binary fission reproduction (E. coli, Streptococcus)

Archaea - Prokaryotic domain, no peptidoglycan, unique membrane lipids, live in extreme environments (hyperthermophiles, halophiles, methanogens)

Eukarya - Eukaryotic domain, linear chromosomes, complex cellular organization (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista)

Innate behavior - Behavior an organism is born with

Classical conditioning - Organism associates previously neutral stimulus with response-triggering stimulus, learning via association

Imprinting - Irreversible learning process that occurs early in life (ducks following first moving object)

Operant conditioning - Strength of behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment, learning via consequence

Xylem - Vascular tissue that transports water and minerals upwards, made of dead cells

Dermal Tissue - Outer protective tissue of plants, contains stomata for gas exchange

Apical Meristem - Region of actively dividing cells at tips of shoots and roots

Phloem - Vascular tissue that transports sugars and nutrients, made of living cells

Microbiology - Study of microscopic organisms

Virology - Branch of microbiology focused on viruses

Carpology - Study of fruits and seeds

Ethology - Study of animal behavior

Stoma/Stomata - Pores on leaf’s surface, allows for gas exchange

Anther - Part of stamen that produces pollen

Stamen - Male reproductive structure of flower, contains anther and filament

Filament - Stalk of stamen that holds up anther

Pistil/Carpel - Female reproductive structure of flower, contains stigma, style, and ovary

Stigma - Top part of pistil that receives pollen

Style - Stalk of pistil that connects stigma and ovary

Ovary - Base of pistil where ovules are produced and seeds develop

Ovule - Structure inside ovary that develops into seed after fertilization

Sepal - Leaf-like structure that protects flower bud

Petal - Colorful part of flower that attracts pollinators

Pseudopod - Temporary extension of cell in amoebas used for movement or food consumption

Mucilaginous - Tissue that’s thick and rich in mucilage (carb that retains water and provides protection)

Capsule - Slime layer, mucilaginous coating that covers bacterial cell walls

Archaeplastida - Primary photosynthetic organisms, evolved from ancestor who swallowed cyanobacterium (red algae, green algae, land plants)

Stramenopiles - Includes diatoms and giant kelp/brown algae, hairy flagella (SAR)

Alveolates - Includes dinoflagellates and malaria-causing parasites (SAR)

Rhizarians - Mostly amoeba-like organisms w/thread-like pseudopods (SAR)

Excavata - Has feeding groove excavated from a side of the body, unicellular and move w/flagella (Euglena, Giardia, Trypanosoma)

Amoebozoa - Classic amoeba, move using pseudopodia (tube-shaped extensions)

Opisthokonta - Includes broad range of life, from animals to fungi, contains single posterior flagellum at some point (sperm cell)

Sporophyte - Dominant, diploid plant generation

Gametophyte - Haploid plant generation
