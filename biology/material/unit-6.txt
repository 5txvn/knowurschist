Genetic Drift - Random changes in allele frequency due to chance

Homologous - Structures w/different functions but same evolutionary origin (arm, wing)

Vestigial - Structure that lost most its function through evolution (appendix)

Analogous - Structures w/similar functions but different evolutionary origin

Punctuated Equilibrium - Species experience equilibrium interrupted by rapid environmental evolutionary change

Convergent Evolution - Unrelated species evolve similar traits due to similar environments

Parallel evolution - Related species evolve in similar ways due to similar environments

Homology - Traits in different species share common ancestry

Gradualism - Evolution is slow and steady

Coevolution - Species influence each other’s evolution due to close ecological interactions

Adaptive Radiation - Single species rapidly diversifies into many different species with different niches

Fitness - Ability of organism to survive and reproduce in an environment

Prezygotic Isolation - Barriers that prevent fertilization before zygotes form

Postzygotic Isolation - Barriers after fertilization occurs

Temporal Isolation - Species mate at different times

Geographic Isolation - Populations are separated by physical barriers

Behavioral Isolation - Different species have different courtship behaviors

Mechanical Isolation - Different species have incompatible reproductive organs

Gametic Isolation - Sperm and egg cannot fuse together

Reduced Hybrid Variability - Embryo dies early

Reduced Hybrid Fertility - Hybrid survives but is sterile

Hybrid Breakdown - First-generation hybrid is viable, later generations aren’t

Directional Selection - Favors one extreme phenotype

Stabilizing Selection - Favors intermediate phenotypes

Disruptive/Diversifying Selection - Favors both extremes, against the intermediate

Sympatric Speciation - Formation of a new species without geographic isolation

Allopatric Speciation - Formation of a new species with geographic isolation

Founder Effect - Reduced genetic diversity in a small starting population

Atavism - Re-emergence of an organism’s ancestral trait

Translational Species - Exhibits ancestral and descendant species characteristics
