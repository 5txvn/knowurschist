Porifera - Sponges, simplest tissue- and organ-lacking organisms, asymmetrical filled with pores, sessile/stationary

Cnidaria - Jellyfish & corals, central digestive compartment, radial symmetry, cnidocytes (stinging cells)

Platyhelminthes - Flatworms, unsegmented with bilateral symmetry and three tissue layers, no body cavity (tapeworms)

Nematoda - Roundworms, unsegmented, parasitic, complete digestive tract (hookworms, pinworms)

Annelida - Segmented worms, true body cavity, closed circulatory system (earthworms, leeches)

Mollusca - Mollusks, soft-bodied w/hard shell, contains muscular foot for movement, visceral mass (organs), mantle/shell (snails, clams, octopi, squid)

Arthropoda - Arthropods, segmented w/hard outer shell & jointed limbs, chitin exoskeleton, largest phylum (insects, crabs, spiders)

Echinodermata - Marine animals w/spiny exoskeleton, radial symmetry and water vascular system for movement (starfish, sea urchins, sand dollars)

Chordata - Chordates, animals w/spinal cords, includes all vertebrae (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, humans)

Primary succession - Community is established where no life previously existed

Secondary succession - Community is established where life previously existed but was disturbed or removed

Facilitation - Process where early species modify environment to make it suitable for later species

Inhibition - Early species prevent or slow growth of later species

Toleration - Species are largely unaffected by early colonizers

Eutrophication - Excessive nutrient buildup (i.e., nitrogen/phosphorus) in water that causes algae overgrowth and reduces oxygen

Biomagnification - Increasing concentration of toxins in organisms at high trophic levels
